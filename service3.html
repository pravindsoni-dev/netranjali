                <h2>Impantable Phakic Lenses</h2>
                <p align="justify">Phakic IOLs (intraocular lenses) are an alternative to LASIK and PRK eye surgery for
                    correcting moderate to severe myopia (nearsightedness), and in some cases produce better and more
                    predictable vision outcomes than laser refractive surgery. (Phakic means An eye that still has its
                    natural lens. When an eye is aphakic, usually the lens has been removed during cataract or other eye
                    surgery)
                </p>
                <p align="justify">Phakic IOLs are clear implantable lenses that are surgically placed either between
                    the cornea and the iris (the colored portion of your eye) or just behind the iris, without removing
                    your natural lens. Phakic lenses enable light to focus properly on the retina for clearer vision
                    without corrective eyewear.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">Implantable lenses function like contact lenses to correct nearsightedness. The
                    difference is that phakic IOLs work from within your eye instead of sitting on the surface of your
                    eye.
                </p>

                <h3>BEST CANDIDATES</h3>
                <p align="justify">
                    High myopia, ineligible for LASIK
                <ul style="text-align:justify">
                    <li><b>Procedure time:</b> about 15 minutes per eye</li>
                    <li><b>Typical results:</b> 20/40 vision or better without glasses or contact lenses</li>
                    <li><b>Recovery time:</b> a few days to several weeks</li>
                </ul>

                Also, phakic IOLs offer a permanent correction of myopia, unless the lens is surgically removed.
                <br>
                Unlike contact lenses, you can't feel a phakic intraocular lens in your eye (much like you don't feel a
                dental filling for a cavity) and, apart from regular eye exams, phakic IOLs typically do not require any
                maintenance.

                </p>


                <h3>Phakic IOLs vs. LASIK Eye Surgery</h3>
                <p align="justify">LASIK currently is the most popular type of refractive surgery in the United States.
                    It is safe and effective, and technology advances such as custom LASIK and bladeless LASIK have made
                    visual outcomes even better.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    But not everyone is a good candidate for LASIK surgery. Potential reasons for not being a good LASIK
                    candidate include: having too much nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism; having an
                    unusually thin or irregularly shaped cornea; and having eye conditions such as keratoconus or dry
                    eye syndrome.

                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    For many people who are outside the treatment range of LASIK, phakic intraocular lenses can produce
                    excellent results.

                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    One recent study that evaluated LASIK versus phakic IOL surgery for the correction of -6.00 to
                    -20.00 D of myopia revealed that the two procedures produced essentially equal odds of attaining
                    20/20 vision without corrective lenses one year after surgery.

                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    The study also found that patients who underwent phakic IOL implantation had better contrast
                    sensitivity and were more satisfied with their outcome than LASIK patients. Neither technique caused
                    significant complications that permanently affected vision.

                </p>


                <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p align="justify">Common to all ocular procedures there are concerns for inflammation, infection, and
                    bleeding resulting from surgical trauma especially to the iris. Since these procedures entail larger
                    cornea and sclera incisions, the risk of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment are notable risks.
                    With the insertion of an artificial prosthetic in or near the angle elevated intraocular pressures
                    from pupil block and angle scarring are concerning. Therefore, sizing of the prosthetic is critical
                    for a good fit that induces little collateral damage to surrounding ocular structures. In extreme
                    circumstances high intraocular pressures for extended periods of time can lead to permanent vision
                    loss. Chronic intraocular pressure elevation can produce indolent vision damage from angle closure
                    glaucoma. The surgical procedure itself also induces some endothelial cell damage and if the
                    prosthetic is in close proximity to the cornea, chronic loss could be induced. Finally, chronic
                    inflammation or prosthetic-lens touch can induce cataract formation. </p>
