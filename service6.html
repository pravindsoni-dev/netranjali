				<h2>What Is Glaucoma?</h2>
				<p align="justify">Glaucoma refers to a group of related eye disorders that all cause damage to the
					optic nerve that carries information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma usually has few or no
					initial symptoms. It usually happens when fluid builds up in the front part of eye. That extra fluid
					increases the pressure in eye (Intraocular pressure-IOP), damaging the optic nerve. But it also can
					occur when intraocular pressure (IOP) is normal. If untreated or uncontrolled, glaucoma first causes
					peripheral vision loss and eventually can lead to blindness.</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness for people over 60 years old. But blindness from glaucoma
					can often be prevented with early treatment.

				<h3>Types of glaucoma</h3>
				<p align="justify">
				<ul style="text-align:justify">
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Primary open-angle glaucoma </b> This common type of glaucoma gradually reduces your
							peripheral vision without other symptoms. By the time you notice it, permanent damage
							already has occurred.
						</p>
						<p>
							If your IOP remains high, the destruction caused by POAG can progress until tunnel vision
							develops, and you will be able to see only objects that are straight ahead. Ultimately, all
							vision can be lost, causing blindness.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Acute angle-closure glaucoma </b> Also called narrow-angle glaucoma, acute angle-closure
							glaucoma produces sudden symptoms such as eye pain, headaches, halos around lights, dilated
							pupils, vision loss, red eyes, nausea and vomiting.
						</p>
						<p>
							These signs constitute a medical emergency. The attack may last for a few hours, and then
							return again for another round, or it may be continuous without relief. Each attack can
							cause progressively more vision loss.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Normal-tension glaucoma </b> Like POAG, normal-tension glaucoma (also called
							normal-pressure glaucoma, low-tension glaucoma or low-pressure glaucoma) is a type of
							open-angle glaucoma that can cause visual field loss due to optic nerve damage. But in
							normal-tension glaucoma, the eye's IOP remains in the normal range.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, pain is unlikely and permanent damage to the eye's optic nerve may not be noticed
							until symptoms such as tunnel vision occur.
						</p>
						<p>
							The cause of normal-tension glaucoma is not known. But many doctors believe it is related to
							poor blood flow to the optic nerve. Normal-tension glaucoma is more common in those who are
							Japanese, are female and/or have a history of vascular disease.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Pigmentary glaucoma </b> This rare form of glaucoma is caused by clogging of the drainage
							angle of the eye by pigment that has broken loose from the iris, reducing the rate of
							aqueous outflow from the eye. Over time, an inflammatory response to the blocked angle
							damages the drainage system.
						</p>
						<p>
							You are unlikely to notice any symptoms with pigmentary glaucoma, though some pain and
							blurry vision may occur after exercise. Pigmentary glaucoma most frequently affects white
							males in their mid-30s to mid-40s.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Secondary glaucoma </b> Symptoms of chronic glaucoma following an eye injury could
							indicate secondary glaucoma, which also may develop with presence of eye infection,
							inflammation, a tumor or enlargement of the lens due to a cataract.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Congenital glaucoma </b> Symptoms of chronic glaucoma following an eye injury could
							indicate secondary glaucoma, which also may develop with presence of eye infection,
							inflammation, a tumor or enlargement of the lens due to a cataract.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				</p>

				<h3>Causes of Glaucoma</h3>
				<p align="justify">
				<ol style="text-align:justify">
					<li>Age Related (Increased risk with increasing age, mainly starts after 40-45yrs age)</li>
					<li> Hereditary (Increased risk with first or second degree relative having glaucoma) </li>
					<li>Idiopathic (No Cause Identified)</li>
					<li> Systemic Disorders like Hypertension, Diabetes increases risk of glaucoma.</li>
					<li> Other Causes: Trauma, Cataract Related, Some congential disorders.</li>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>Glaucoma Symptoms</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Glaucoma often is called the "silent thief of sight," because most types typically cause no pain and
					produce no symptoms until noticeable vision loss occurs.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					For this reason, glaucoma often progresses undetected until the optic nerve already has been
					irreversibly damaged, with varying degrees of permanent vision loss.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					But with acute angle-closure glaucoma, symptoms that occur suddenly can include blurry vision, halos
					around lights, intense eye pain, nausea and vomiting. If you have these symptoms, make sure you see
					an eye care practitioner or visit the emergency room immediately so steps can be taken to prevent
					permanent vision loss.
				</p>

				<h3>Diagnosis, Screening And Tests For Glaucoma</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					During routine eye exams, a tonometer is used to measure your intraocular pressure, or IOP. Your eye
					typically is numbed with eye drops, and a small probe gently rests against your eye's surface. Other
					tonometers send a puff of air onto your eye's surface.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					An abnormally high IOP reading indicates a problem with the amount of fluid (aqueous humor) in the
					eye. Either the eye is producing too much fluid, or it's not draining properly.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Normally, IOP should be below 21 mmHg (millimeters of mercury) — a unit of measurement based on how
					much force is exerted within a certain defined area.
				</p>

				<p align="center">
					<img src="img/glaucoma02.jpg" alt="Glaucoma" />
					<img src="img/glaucoma03.jpg" alt="Glaucoma" />
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					If your IOP is higher than 30 mmHg, your risk of vision loss from glaucoma is 40 times greater than
					someone with intraocular pressure of 15 mmHg or lower. This is why glaucoma treatments such as eye
					drops are designed to keep IOP low.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Other methods of monitoring glaucoma involve the use of sophisticated imaging technology — such as
					<b>scanning laser polarimetry</b> (SLP), <b>optical coherence tomography</b> (OCT) and <b>confocal
						scanning laser ophthalmoscopy</b> — to create baseline images and measurements of the eye's
					optic nerve and internal structures.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Then, at specified intervals, additional images and measurements are taken to make sure no changes
					have occurred over time that might indicate progressive glaucoma damage.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					<b>Visual field testing</b> is a way for your eye doctor to determine if you are experiencing vision
					loss from glaucoma. Visual field testinginvolves staring straight ahead into a machine and clicking
					a button when you notice a blinking light in your peripheral vision. The visual field test may be
					repeated at regular intervals to make sure you are not developing blind spots from damage to the
					optic nerve or to determine the extent or progression of vision loss from glaucoma.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					<b>Gonioscopy</b> also may be performed to make sure the aqueous humor (or "aqueous") can drain
					freely from the eye. In gonioscopy, special lenses are used with a biomicroscope to enable your eye
					doctor to see the structure inside the eye (called the drainage angle) that controls the outflow of
					aqueous and thereby affects intraocular pressure. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is another technique that
					may be used to evaluate the drainage angle.

				</p>


				<h3>Glaucoma Treatments</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Treatment can involve glaucoma surgery, lasers or medication, depending on the severity. Eye drops
					with medication aimed at lowering IOP usually are tried first to control glaucoma.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Because glaucoma often is painless, people may become careless about strict use of eye drops that
					can control eye pressure and help prevent permanent eye damage.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					In fact, non-compliance with a program of prescribed glaucoma medication is a major reason for
					blindness caused by glaucoma. If you find that the eye drops you are using for glaucoma are
					uncomfortable or inconvenient, never discontinue them without first consulting your eye doctor about
					a possible alternative therapy.
				</p>


				<h3>Glaucoma Prevention</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Can you reduce your risk for glaucoma? According to a recent European study, exercise might do the
					trick for some people.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Researchers in the U.K. have found that higher levels of physical exercise appear to provide a
					long-term benefit of reducing the incidence of low ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), an important
					risk factor for glaucoma. OPP is a mathematical value that is calculated using a person's
					intraocular pressure and his or her blood pressure.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">The results showed that study participants who engaged in moderate physical exercise
					approximately 15 years prior to the study had a 25 percent reduced risk of low OPP that could lead
					to glaucoma.
				</p>


				<h3>TAKE HOME MESSAGE FOR PATIENTS</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Glaucoma can be diagnosed early and blindness can be prevented through regular eye examination
					especially after 40 yrs age. also if any of your blood relatives has or had history of glaucoma it’s
					important to get screened for glaucoma by your ophthalmologist at appropriate time.
