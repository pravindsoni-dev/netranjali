				<h2>What Are Cataracts?</h2>

				<p align="justify">
					Cataracts are not a disease per se, its age related changes in natural lens of eye. Inside our eyes,
					we have a natural lens which bends (refracts) light rays that come into the eye to help us see. The
					lens should be clear, like the top lens in the illustration.

				</p>
				</p>

				<h3>Vision problems with cataracts</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					If you have a cataract, your lens has become cloudy, like the bottom lens in the illustration. It is
					like looking through a foggy or dusty car windshield. Things look blurry, hazy or less colorful with
					a cataract.
				</p>


				<h3>Cataract Symptoms</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Most age-related cataracts develop gradually. As a result, you may not notice signs or changes in
					your vision right away when cataracts first develop.
				</p>

				<h3>Cataract symptom progression</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Here are some vision changes you may notice if you have a cataract:
				<ul>
					<li>Having blurry vision.</li>
					<li>Seeing double (when you see two images instead of one).</li>
					<li>Being extra sensitive to light.</li>
					<li>Having trouble seeing well at night, or needing more light when you read.</li>
					<li>Seeing bright colors as faded or yellow instead.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Cataract Causes</h3>
				<p align="justify">
				<ul>
					<li><b>Age-related</b> These form as you get older.</li>
					<li><b>Congenital</b> This is what when babies are born with cataracts. They may be caused by
						infection, injury, or poor development in the womb. Or, they can form in childhood.</li>
					<li><b>Secondary</b> These happen as a result of other medical conditions, like diabetes. They can
						also result from being around toxic substances, ultraviolet light, or radiation, or from taking
						medicines such as corticosteroids or diuretics.</li>
					<li><b>Traumatic</b> These form after an injury to the eye</li>
				</ul>
				Other things that can raise your chances of getting cataracts include cigarette smoke, air pollution,
				and heavy drinking.
				</p>


				<h3>Cataract Treatment</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Cataracts can be removed only with surgery. If your cataract symptoms are not bothering you very
					much, you don’t have to remove a cataract. You might just need a new eyeglass prescription to help
					you see better. You should consider surgery when cataracts keep you from doing things you want or
					need to do.
				</p>

				<h3>Cataract Surgery</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Cataract surgery is an operation to remove your eye’s lens when it is cloudy. During cataract
					surgery, your cloudy natural lens is removed and replaced with a clear artificial lens. That lens is
					called an intraocular lens (IOL). Surgery is usually 'outpatient' and performed using local
					anesthesia or topical anaseshtesia (Using only numbing drops for surgery, no injection).
					Phacoemulsification is the most widely used cataract surgery in the developed world. This procedure
					uses ultrasonic energy to emulsify the cataract lens. Usually your surgeon will not need to stitch
					the incisions closed. These “self sealing” incisions eventually will close by themselves over time.
				</p>


				<h3>IOL Implants: Lens Replacement and Cataract Surgery</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					An intraocular lens (or IOL) is a tiny, artificial lens for the eye. It replaces the eye’s natural
					lens that is removed during cataract surgery. The lens bends (refracts) light rays that enter the
					eye, helping you to see. Your lens should be clear. But if you have a cataract, your lens has become
					cloudy. Things look blurry, hazy or less colorful with a cataract. Cataract surgery removes this
					cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear IOL to improve your vision. IOLs come in different focusing
					powers, just like prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. Your ophthalmologist will measure the
					length of your eye and the curve of your cornea. These measurements are used to set your IOLs
					focusing power.
				<dl>
					<dt>Monofocal IOLs</dt>
					<dd>The most common type of lens used with cataract surgery is called a monofocal IOL. It has one
						focusing distance. It is set to focus for up close, medium range or distance vision. Most people
						have them set for clear distance vision. Then they wear eyeglasses for reading or close work.
					</dd>
					<br>
					<dt>Multifocal IOLs</dt>
					<dd>These IOLs provide both distance and near focus at the same time. The lens has different zones
						set at different powers. It is designed so that your brain learns to select the right focus
						automatically.</dd>
					<br>
					<dt>Toric IOLs</dt>
					<dd>For people with astigmatism, there is an IOL called a toric lens. Astigmatism is a refractive
						error caused by an uneven curve in your cornea or lens. The toric lens is designed to correct
						that refractive error.</dd>

				<h3>What are the risks of cataract surgery?</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Like any surgery, cataract surgery carries risks of problems or complications. Here are some of
					those risks:
				<ul>
					<li>Eye infection.</li>
					<li>Bleeding in the eye.</li>
					<li>Ongoing swelling of the front of the eye or inside of the eye.</li>
					<li>Swelling of the retina (the nerve layer at the back of your eye).</li>
					<li>Detached retina (when the retina lifts up from the back of the eye).</li>
					<li>Damage to other parts of your eye.</li>
					<li>Pain that does not get better with over-the-counter medicine.</li>
					<li>Vision loss.</li>
					<li>The IOL implant may become dislocated, moving out of position</li>
				</ul>
				Your vision could become cloudy or blurry weeks, months or years after cataract surgery. This is not
				unusual. If you notice cloudy vision again, you might need to have a laser procedure. Called a posterior
				capsulotomy, this procedure helps restore clear vision.
