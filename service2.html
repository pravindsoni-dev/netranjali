                <p align="justify">If you have a refractive error, such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness
                    (hyperopia), astigmatism or presbyopia, refractive surgery is a method for correcting or improving
                    your vision. There are various surgical procedures for correcting or adjusting your eye's focusing
                    ability by reshaping the cornea, or clear, round dome at the front of your eye. Other procedures
                    involve implanting a lens inside your eye. The most widely performed type of refractive surgery is
                    LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis), where a laser is used to reshape the
                    cornea.<br>Refractive surgery might be a good option for you if you:</p>
                <p align="justify">
                <ul style="text-align:justify">
                    <li>Want to decrease your dependence on glasses or contact lenses;</li>
                    <li>Are free of eye disease;</li>
                    <li>Accept the inherent risks and potential side effects of the procedure;</li>
                    <li>Understand that you could still need glasses or contacts after the procedure to achieve your
                        best vision;</li>
                    <li>Have an appropriate refractive error.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p align="justify">There is no universally-accepted, best method for correcting refractive errors. The
                    best option for you should be decided after a thorough examination and discussion with your
                    ophthalmologist. </p>
                <p align="justify">LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) is an outpatient refractive surgery
                    procedure used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. A laser is used to reshape
                    the cornea — the clear, round dome at the front of the eye — to improve the way the eye focuses
                    light rays onto the retina at the back of the eye.</p>
                <p align="justify">With LASIK, an ophthalmologist creates a thin flap in the cornea using either a blade
                    or a laser. The surgeon folds back the flap and precisely removes a very specific amount of corneal
                    tissue under the flap using an excimer laser. The flap is then laid back into its original position
                    where it heals in place.</p>
                <p align="justify">For people who are nearsighted, LASIK is used to flatten a cornea that is too steep.
                    Farsighted people will have LASIK to achieve a steeper cornea. LASIK can also correct astigmatism by
                    shaping an irregular cornea into a more normal shape.</p>
                <p align="justify">It is important that anyone considering LASIK have realistic expectations. LASIK
                    allows people to perform most of their everyday tasks without corrective lenses. However, people
                    looking for perfect vision without glasses or contacts run the risk of being disappointed. More than
                    90 percent of people who have LASIK achieve somewhere between 20/20 and 20/40 vision without glasses
                    or contact lenses. If sharp, detailed 20/20 vision is essential for your job or leisure activities,
                    consider whether 20/40 vision would be good enough for you.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">You should be comfortable with the possibility that you may need a second surgery
                    (called a retreatment or enhancement) or that you might need to wear glasses for certain activities,
                    such as reading or driving at night. Also, you should be aware that LASIK cannot correct presbyopia,
                    the age-related loss of close-up focusing power.</p>

                <h3>How the LASIK procedure works</h3>
                <p align="justify">LASIK is performed while the patient reclines under a surgical device called an
                    excimer laser in an outpatient surgical suite.
                    <br>

                    First, the eye is numbed with a few drops of topical anesthetic. An eyelid holder is placed between
                    the eyelids to keep them open and prevent the patient from blinking. A suction ring placed on the
                    eye lifts and flattens the cornea and helps keep the eye from moving. The patient may feel pressure
                    from the eyelid holder and suction ring, similar to a finger pressed firmly on the eyelid.<br>

                    From the time the suction ring is put on the eye until it is removed, vision appears dim or goes
                    black. Once the cornea is flattened, a hinged flap of corneal tissue is created using an automated
                    microsurgical device, either a laser or blade. This corneal flap is lifted and folded back. Then the
                    excimer laser preprogrammed with the patient's unique eye measurements is centered above the
                    eye.<br>

                    The surgeon checks that the laser is positioned correctly. The patient looks at a special pinpoint
                    light, called a fixation or target light, while the excimer laser sculpts the corneal tissue. Then
                    the surgeon places the flap back into position and smoothes the edges. The corneal flap sticks to
                    the underlying corneal tissue within two to five minutes, and stitches are not needed.<br>

                    The patient should plan to have someone drive him or her home after the procedure and then take a
                    nap or just relax. To help protect the cornea as it heals, the surgeon may place a transparent
                    shield over the eye(s) to protect against accidental bumps and to remind the patient not to rub the
                    eye(s). The patient may need to wear the shield only when sleeping. The surgeon will provide
                    eyedrops to help the eye heal and relieve dryness.<br>

                    It may take three to six months after LASIK surgery for the improvements in a person's vision to
                    fully stabilize and any side effects to go away.
                </p>

                <h3>LASIK risks and side effects</h3>
                <p align="justify">
                    LASIK, like any surgery, has potential risks and complications that should be carefully considered.
                    Since it was approved by the FDA in 1998, LASIK is has become a popular treatment in the United
                    States and the overall complication rate is low. Infection and inflammation are possibilities, as
                    with any surgical procedure, and usually can be cleared up with medications.<br>

                    Problems with the corneal flap after surgery sometimes make further treatment necessary. There is a
                    chance, though small, that vision will not be as good after the surgery as before, even with glasses
                    or contacts.<br>

                    Some people experience side effects after LASIK that usually disappear over time. These side effects
                    may include hazy or blurry vision; difficulty with night vision and/or driving at night;
                    scratchiness, dryness and other symptoms of the condition called "dry eye"; glare, halos or
                    starbursts around lights; light sensitivity; discomfort or pain; or small pink or red patches on the
                    white of the eye. In a small minority of patients, some of these effects may be permanent.<br>

                    Sometimes a second surgery, called a retreatment or enhancement, may be needed to achieve the
                    desired vision correction. This is more likely for people who were more nearsighted, farsighted, or
                    had higher astigmatism before LASIK — those whose vision originally needed more intensive
                    correction. Approximately 10.5 percent of LASIK patients in the United States require a
                    retreatment.<br>

                    If you want the sharpest vision possible after laser vision correction, a procedure you definitely
                    should consider is custom wavefront LASIK.

                </p>


                <h3>What Is Custom Wavefront LASIK?</h3>

                <p align="justify">
                    Custom wavefront LASIK — also called "custom LASIK" or "wavefront LASIK" — adds a greater degree of
                    precision and personalization to LASIK vision correction surgery by using advanced wavefront
                    technology to evaluate the unique characteristics of your eyes.<br>

                    Conventional LASIK surgery attempts to recreate the vision correction that your eyeglass
                    prescription provides. But eyeglass prescriptions are not unique — thousands, even millions, of
                    people can have the same eyeglass prescription. And because of unique characteristics of each
                    person's eyes that cannot be measured with the conventional technology used to determine refractive
                    error during an eye exam, people who have the same eyeglasses prescription will see the world with
                    different degrees of clarity with those same prescription lenses.<br>

                    Custom LASIK uses much more detailed information than a conventional eyeglasses prescription to
                    program the excimer laser that reshapes your eye during the vision correction procedure. The
                    wavefront technology used for custom LASIK makes the procedure superior to a conventional LASIK
                    procedure in two ways:
                <p align="center">
                    <img src="img/lasik01.jpg" alt="lasik"></img>
                </p>
                <ul style="text-align:justify">
                    <li>
                        <b>Custom wavefront LASIK is more precise </b>
                        During a routine eye exam, your doctor will introduce different lenses in front of your eyes
                        while you are looking at an eye chart and ask, "Which lens makes the letters look clearer — lens
                        1 or lens 2?" Sometimes the lenses will look the same, and it's hard to choose which one makes
                        the chart look clearer. Maybe a lens in between the two?<br>

                        Each "click" on the dial of that instrument your doctor uses to determine your eyeglasses
                        prescription represents the smallest unit of power used to manufacture a conventional pair of
                        eyeglasses, which is 0.25 diopter (D). This is why your eyeglass prescription has numbers like
                        -1.25 D and -1.50 D, but not 1.3 D.<br>

                        With custom wavefront LASIK, the power of lenses required to correct your vision is measured in
                        0.01 D units. In other words, imagine if during your eye exam, instead of having just "lens 1"
                        and "lens 2" to choose from, you had 24 additional lenses in between these two to choose from!
                        Thankfully, choosing the lens that most accurately corrects your vision for a custom LASIK
                        procedure is done instantaneously by a computer, instead of making you decide.<br>

                        So, by evaluating the refractive errors of your eyes in 0.01 D increments (instead of 0.25 D
                        increments, as in a routine eye exam), measurements used for custom wavefront LASIK are 25 times
                        more precise than lens powers used in an eyeglasses prescription.<br>

                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <b>Custom wavefront LASIK is more specific </b> What does this mean? When your doctor is
                        determining your eyeglass prescription during your eye exam, he or she is evaluating your eye's
                        ability to focus light as a unified whole. One lens prescription is determined for your entire
                        eye.
                        In addition to the much greater precision of measurements taken for custom LASIK, these
                        measurements are gathered from hundreds of separate reference points on the front surface of the
                        eye. All these data are gathered and used to create a detailed map of the refractive error and
                        focusing imperfections called higher-order aberrations across the entire cornea, and then used
                        to program the laser to deliver a 100 percent personalized vision correction for your specific
                        needs.
