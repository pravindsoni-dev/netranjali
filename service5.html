				<h2>Penetrating & Lamellar Keratoplasty</h2>


				<p align="justify">A cornea transplant replaces diseased or scarred corneal tissue with healthy tissue
					from an organ donor.
					There are two main types of cornea transplants: traditional, full thickness cornea transplant (also
					known as penetrating keratoplasty, or PK) and back layer cornea transplant (also known as
					endothelial keratoplasty, or EK).
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					A graft replaces central corneal tissue, damaged due to disease or eye injury, with healthy corneal
					tissue donated from a local eye bank. An unhealthy cornea affects your vision by scattering or
					distorting light and causing glare and blurred vision. A cornea transplant may be necessary to
					restore your functional vision.
					Corneal eye disease is the fourth most common cause of blindness (after cataracts, glaucoma and
					age-related macular degeneration) and affects more than 10 million people worldwide.
				</p>



				<p align="justify">
				<ol style="text-align:justify">
					<li>A subcapsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. People with diabetes or those taking high
						doses of steroid medications have a greater risk of developing a subcapsular cataract.</li>
					<li>A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. Nuclear cataracts
						usually are associated with aging.</li>
					<li>A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacities that start in the periphery
						of the lens and work their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion. This type of cataract
						occurs in the lens cortex, which is the part of the lens that surrounds the central nucleus.

				<h3>When Do You Need a Cornea Transplant?</h3>
				<p align="justify">A healthy, clear cornea is essential for good vision. If your cornea is damaged due
					to eye disease or eye injury, it can become swollen, scarred or severely misshapen and distort your
					vision.</p>
				<p align="justify">Certain conditions can affect the clarity of your cornea and put you at greater risk
					of corneal failure. These include:
				<ul style="text-align:justify">
					<li>Scarring from infections, such as eye herpesor fungal keratitis.</li>
					<li>Scarring from trichiasis, when eyelashes grow inwardly, toward the eye, and rub against the
						cornea.</li>
					<li>Hereditary conditions such as Fuchs' dystrophy.</li>
					<li>Eye diseases such as advanced keratoconus.</li>
					<li>Thinning of the cornea and irregular corneal shape (such as with keratoconus).</li>
					<li>Rare complications from LASIK surgery.</li>
					<li>Chemical burns of the cornea or damage from an eye injury.</li>
					<li>Excessive swelling (edema) of the cornea.</li>
					<li>Graft rejection following a previous corneal transplant.</li>
					<li>Corneal failure due to cataract surgery complications.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>





				<h3>Penetrating keratoplasty</h3>
				<h6>Replacement of the entire cornea</h6>
				<p align="justify">A trephine (a circular cutting device), which removes a circular disc of cornea, is
					used by the surgeon to cut the donor cornea. A second trephine is then used to remove a
					similar-sized portion of the patient's cornea. The donor tissue is then sewn in place with sutures.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Antibiotic eyedrops are placed, the eye is patched, and the patient is taken to a recovery area
					while the effects of the anesthesia wear off. The patient typically goes home following this and
					sees the doctor the following day for the first postoperative appointment.
				</p>
				<p align="center">

				</p>
				<h3>Lamellar keratoplasty</h3>

				<p align="justify">
					Lamellar keratoplasty encompasses several techniques which selectively replace diseased layers of
					the cornea while leaving healthy layers in place. The chief advantage is improved tectonic integrity
					of the eye. Disadvantages include the technically challenging nature of these procedures, which
					replace portions of a structure only 500 µm thick, and reduced optical performance of the
					donor/recipient interface compared to full-thickness keratoplasty.
				</p>

				<h3>Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty</h3>

				<p align="justify">
					In this procedure, the anterior layers of the central cornea are removed and replaced with donor
					tissue. Endothelial cells and the Descemets membrane are left in place. This technique is used in
					cases of anterior corneal opacifications, scars, and ectatic diseases such as keratoconus.

				</p>

				<p align="center">
					<img src="img/lk02.jpg" alt="Penetrating & Lamellar Keratoplasty" />
				</p>

				<h3>Endothelial keratoplasty</h3>

				<p align="justify">
					Endothelial keratoplasty replaces the patient's endothelium with a transplanted disc of posterior
					stroma/Descemets/endothelium (DSEK) or Descemets/endothelium (DMEK).
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					This relatively new procedure has revolutionized treatment of disorders of the innermost layer of
					the cornea (endothelium). Unlike a full-thickness corneal transplant, the surgery can be performed
					with one or no sutures. Patients may recover functional vision in days to weeks, as opposed to up to
					a year with full thickness transplants. However, an Australian study has shown that despite its
					benefits, the loss of endothelial cells that maintain transparency is much higher in DSEK compared
					to a full-thickness corneal transplant. The reason may be greater tissue manipulation during
					surgery, the study concluded.[3]
				</p <p align="justify">
				During surgery the patient's corneal endothelium is removed and replaced with donor tissue. With DSEK,
				the donor includes a thin layer of stroma, as well as endothelium, and is commonly 100–150 µm thick.
				With DMEK, only the endothelium is transplanted. In the immediate postoperative period the donor tissue
				is held in position with an air bubble placed inside the eye (the anterior chamber). The tissue
				self-adheres in a short period and the air is adsorbed into the surrounding tissues.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Complications include displacement of the donor tissue requiring repositioning ("refloating"). This
					is more common with DMEK than DSEK. Folds in the donor tissue may reduce the quality of vision,
					requiring repair. Rejection of the donor tissue may require repeating the procedure. Gradual
					reduction in endothelial cell density over time can lead to loss of clarity and require repeating
					the procedure.

				<h3>Cornea Graft Rejection</h3>

				<p align="justify">
					Cornea transplants are performed routinely and have a reasonable success rate. In fact, cornea
					grafts are the most successful of all tissue transplants.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Like any other surgical procedure, a cornea transplant comes with certain risks. But, for most
					people, having their vision improved or restored outweighs the potential complications associated
					with cornea transplant surgery. It is a very personal decision for a patient to decide to undergo
					cornea transplant surgery.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Complications of a corneal transplant can be significant and can include cornea graft rejection, eye
					infection and problems associated with the use of stitches. Rejection of the donor tissue is the
					most serious complication after a corneal transplant and occurs in 5 to 30 percent of patients.
					Transplant rejection is when your body's immune system detects the donor cornea as a foreign body
					and attacks and tries to destroy it.

				</p>

				<p align="justify">
					Research indicates that having glaucoma and corneal swelling associated with previous cataract
					surgery can increase your chances of cornea graft rejection. Recognizing the main warning signs of
					corneal transplant rejection is the first step to preventing graft failure. These can be remembered
					using the acronym <b>RSVP</b>:

				<ul style="text-align:justify">
					<li><b>R</b>edness</li>
					<li>Extreme <b>S</b>ensitivity to light</li>
					<li>Decreased <b>V</b>ision</li>
					<li><b>P</b>ain</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Rejection signs may occur as early as one month or as late as several years after surgery. Your eye
					doctor will prescribe medication that can help reverse the rejection process. If detected early, the
					graft will be successful 9 out of 10 times, according to the Cornea Research Foundation of America.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Should your graft fail, corneal transplant surgery can be repeated. While repeat surgery generally
					has good outcomes, overall rejection rates increase with the number of corneal transplants you have.
